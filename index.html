      <p>I was born and raised in St. Louis, MO.</p>
			<p>Up until July 2016, I lived with two roommates and their two pug mixes...aka my two dog nieces - Zoe &amp Idgie!</p>
			<p>It wasn't until September 2013 that I started writing <a href="http://github.com/jazzturn" target="_blank" class="links">code</a>. #HelloWorld</p>
			<p>In two days I applied for 2 bootcamps and an apprenticeship with LaunchCode. #Adulting</p>
			<p>P.S....because of my horrible code, I bombed all the interviews. :(</p>
			<p>While continuing to study programming, I worked many odd jobs. #MusicTeacher #Musician #LabTechnician #Janitor</p>
			<p>Here's a more formal <a href="resume.html" target="_blank" class="links">r&egravesum&egrave</a> if you'd like to see that.</p>
			<p>My first instrument is my <a href="https://youtu.be/JYatYhlHrQc" target="_blank" class="links">voice</a>, and then piano. Sometimes I can even do both!</p>
			<p>I didn't even realize the black keys on the piano had a purpose until I played Old MacDonald in A minor. Lol.</p>
			<p>I also write songs, and I am currently recording my first EP.</p>
      <p>I am currently enrolled in the CoderGirl Summer 2017 Cohort. Maybe I'll ace my next interview. ;) #YouCodeGirl!</p>
